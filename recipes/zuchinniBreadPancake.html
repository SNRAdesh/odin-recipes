    <p>Our banana bread is one of the most popular and well-reviewed videos I've ever posted.
             When I got the idea to do banana bread pancakes, I decided to use that lovely loaf as 
             the base recipe.

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>

        <li> 1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> ½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li> 3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon milk</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).Coat a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. </li>
        <li>Beat together sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add mashed bananas and mix until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in milk and vanilla. </li>
        <li>Stir in flour mixture, walnuts, and chocolate chips until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap pan on the counter to release any air pockets. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let rest in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bread from the pan, then slice and serve. </li>
